            <h1>The Elite Student</h1>
            <h2>First Day of School</h2>
            <p>The first day of school was nothing special to me. Walking into class 11B at AlSufarra High School, I felt the familiar weight of being different. Everyone knew me as the quiet, introverted student with few friends. They whispered about my autism behind my back, thinking I wasn't aware. The school administration probably thought I was oblivious to this label, but they were wrong. I knew everything. I just chose to keep it to myself. Solitude and peace were my preferences anyway.
                This year brought changes I hadn't asked for. The school's grading system had reshuffled some students, bringing the weaker ones from class 11A into our midst. Initially, I didn't care. I thought maintaining my usual low profile would be simple enough. I was wrong.
                Among these new faces were the troublemakers: Sahar Aldibii, Adam Qirrish, and Ahmad Abo Hammad. Their reputation as bullies preceded them, and Ahmad, particularly, couldn't wait to start. "Hey, Motaz! You lost or something?" he sneered during our first break. "You think you're better than us or just stupid?"
                I kept my silence, as I always had. But these weren't the usual tormentors I could simply ignore. They took turns hurling insults, and for the first time, my silence wasn't the shield it used to be. They were relentless, their attacks growing more frequent with each passing day.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="first-strategy" class="arc-content">
            <h2>The First Strategy: Silence</h2>
            <p>I initially believed my usual approach would work. Silence had always been my trusted weapon—let them tire themselves out and move on. But these three were different. Day after day, Sahar, Adam, and Ahmad circled me like vultures, their insults becoming more pointed, their mockery more public. They made it their mission to call me "lost" and "dumb," questioning my every move.
                I knew then that something had to change. My tried-and-true method wasn't going to cut it this time.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="second-strategy" class="arc-content">
            <h2>The Second Strategy: Observing Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>I decided to turn my silent observation into a weapon. I studied them closely, noting their behaviors, their weaknesses. I watched how they interacted, their addiction to phones during class, their casual disregard for school rules. While they thought no one was paying attention to their jokes and laughter, I was gathering ammunition.
                When I felt I had enough evidence, I made my move. I approached Principal Mahmoud Hadia directly.
                "Principal, I need to report some students who are disrupting class and breaking the rules," I stated plainly.
                His eyebrow raised. "What do you have for me, Motaz?"
                "Sahar Aldibii, Adam Qirrish, and Ahmad Abo Hammad. They constantly use their phones in class and talk over the teachers."
                The surprise on his face was evident. "Those three? They've never caused trouble before."
                I met his gaze steadily. "Have I ever lied to you, sir?"
                "No, you haven't."
                "Then you need to do something. If we want class 11B to stay the best, we can't let this behavior slide."
                He nodded after a moment's consideration. "Alright, I'll handle it."
                The Principal's Warning
                The next day, Principal Mahmoud stormed into our first period, his voice commanding attention. "If I see a phone in this classroom, it's going to be confiscated. No more warnings."
                For a brief moment, I thought I'd won. But within a week, they'd adapted. They started passing phones between themselves, finding ways around the rule. Their disruptions continued, and I felt my frustration growing. It was time for a new approach.</p>

            <h2>The Principal's Warning</h2>
            <p>The next day, Principal Mahmoud stormed into our first period, his voice commanding attention...</p>
        </div>
        <div id="turning-point" class="arc-content">
            <h2>The Turning Point: Gaslighting the Bullies</h2>
            <p>My birthday on October 15th became the catalyst. When Ahmad decided to mock me with "What are you now, 12?" I knew ignoring them wasn't an option anymore. I needed to turn their own game against them. Every time they answered something wrong, I laughed openly. "What a dumbass," I'd say, watching their confidence crack.
                To my satisfaction, it worked. They hated being mocked, especially by someone they considered beneath them. I could see the rage building in their expressions, and it fueled me.
                I took it further, gathering support from the rest of the class. During breaks, I'd casually ask, "Do you guys like these new students?" The majority, already annoyed by the constant disruptions, sided with me.
                "Then let's laugh at everything they do. Let's make them the outsiders," I suggested, planting the seeds of their downfall.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="standing-up" class="arc-content">
            <h2>Standing Up</h2>
            <p>After two days of constant mockery, they finally broke. Ahmad tried to intimidate me during a break, getting in my face with clenched fists. "You want me to beat you up, huh?"
                I looked at him calmly and smirked. "Bite instead of barking."
                He stood there, frozen, his face red with anger. But for the first time, he had no comeback. I knew I'd won that round.
                Later that day, Sahar made one last attempt at humiliation, handing me the trash can. "Here, dumbass. Empty it."
                Without hesitation, I took the trash can and threw it back at him, watching with satisfaction as the trash spilled over his shoes. I walked away without a word, leaving them speechless. They had no idea how to handle someone who refused to play victim.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sticker-incident" class="arc-content">
            <h2>The Sticker Incident</h2>
            <p>I decided to take things further, creating stickers featuring their faces and mocking them on WhatsApp. I shared them with my old classmates in a private group, enjoying their laughter. It felt good to be the one in control. I then had a friend send the stickers to the bullies themselves—a calculated move to provoke them.
                My only mistake was leaving my name visible as the sticker pack's author. They reported me immediately, and I was summoned by the class manager. Before facing her, I made a strategic move—having a male teacher check the stickers first. This backfired when he discovered stickers mocking other teachers as well. The situation quickly escalated to the higher-ups.
                When I faced Mahmoud, the head manager, his fury was evident. "How could you betray me like this?" he demanded, reminding me of the birthday celebration he'd organized for me. I remained silent, not because I felt guilty, but because I knew sometimes silence is the best response.
                But things turned in my favor when Saed, my old classmate, stepped in. He spoke privately with the class manager and Mahmoud, explaining the harassment I'd endured. His intervention changed everything. Mahmoud's anger softened, and he returned my phone, forgiving me with a warning.
                Later that day, I encountered Sahar and Adam. Sahar hit me a few times, but I didn't retaliate—not out of fear, but strategy. Adam tried to play peacemaker, claiming it was all jokes. I responded calmly, "It's fine, I already removed the stickers. Do you want to see?"
                Adam believed me but added a threat: "You have two days to make sure those stickers are completely gone from everyone's phones, or you'll regret it."
                I agreed, knowing when to appear compliant. Later, I messaged Mahmoud about Sahar hitting me. His response was swift: "I'll expel him for real this time."

        <div id="turning-page" class="arc-content">
            <h2>Turning the Page</h2>
            <p>After the sticker incident, my position at AlSufarra High School shifted. I hadn't lost—I'd learned. Direct confrontation had its costs, but I'd discovered more subtle ways to wield power.
                I focused on building my reputation through volunteering and helping around school. This wasn't about seeking approval; it was about positioning myself as indispensable. Working in the computer lab with teacher Dima led to me upgrading 23 computers with the school's operating system—a task that earned me the principal's trust and appreciation.
                Even when a classmate tried to humiliate me by offering a half-eaten sandwich and water bottle, I didn't hesitate to throw the water bottle at them. No one intervened. Instead, Emad, the class leader, supported me: "Just hit them. If they call themselves men and hit you back, they'll face me."
                As midterms approached, I implemented new strategies. I excelled in my studies while cleverly distributing Rubik's cubes to specific students—ensuring they'd be distracted during crucial moments. Every move was calculated, every action purposeful.

        <div id="past" class="arc-content">
            <h2>The Past</h2>
            <p>The echoes of my past linger in every corner of my mind, and no matter how much I try to move forward, it’s as if the weight of those memories never quite leaves me. It’s strange how time works—how something that happened so long ago still finds a way to haunt the present, shaping every decision, every thought, every action.

                I was born into a world that didn't care for me. Not from the moment my mother struggled to carry me, nor from the moment I entered this world prematurely. My life began in a battle for survival, a battle I didn't even ask for. They told my mother I was too fragile to live, that I might not make it through the first few months. I wasn’t supposed to survive, but I did. And for that, I should have been grateful. But somehow, the very gift of life felt like a curse. The burden I placed on my mother was too heavy, and I could see the toll it took on her. I watched her cry at night, not out of sorrow for herself, but out of fear for me.
                
                The early days of my life were filled with uncertainty. The yellow pallor of my skin made the doctors nervous, and they made my mother return day after day to check on me. They told her I had autism, a condition that no one fully understood back then. I couldn't speak, couldn't communicate the way other children did. And all the while, I felt like I was a burden. I saw it in my mother’s eyes—how she tried to balance the weight of the world with the weight of raising me. But it was clear to me that I was more than just a child to her; I was a challenge, a reminder of everything she had to give up.
                
                As I grew older, I became aware of the dysfunction around me. My father, the man who should have been my protector, was instead an unpredictable force of chaos in our lives. His actions—his addictions, his emotional distance, his constant arguing with my mother—shaped my understanding of the world. I remember witnessing him watch things I didn’t understand, things that made my skin crawl, things that left me feeling more alone than ever.
                
                I remember being young and confused, watching the fights, feeling the tension in the air. I couldn't fully comprehend the magnitude of what was happening, but I could feel the pain in my mother’s voice when she begged him to stop. She tried to shield me, but I was old enough to see through the cracks. And I stayed silent. I couldn’t voice what I saw, couldn’t tell anyone about the things that haunted me.
                
                Growing up with autism was never easy. I was treated differently, as if I were less than, as if I didn’t deserve to be seen or heard. People would talk over me, make assumptions, and use me when it suited them. No one saw me for who I was—someone capable of understanding, capable of feeling, capable of being just like anyone else. They saw me as a project, an experiment, a “special” case that needed to be fixed.
                
                And then, in grade 10, something changed. I realized that I had been manipulated all along. I had been made to believe that I was powerless, that I couldn’t control my life. But deep inside, a fire began to burn. I wasn’t just going to be a victim anymore. I wasn’t going to let people walk over me. I wanted to understand manipulation, to take control of my destiny, and that’s when the idea of revenge first crept into my mind. It wasn’t about hurting anyone—it was about regaining the power that had been taken from me my entire life. It was about showing the world that I wasn’t just a child to be pitied, a kid with autism who wouldn’t amount to anything.
                
                By grade 11, I started testing my knowledge of manipulation. I used the tools I had learned to navigate my school, to influence the people around me. I could see things differently now. I understood how people worked, how they used power to control others. I was determined to take that power back, to rewrite my story. But I didn’t know how far I would go, or what it would cost me.
                
                The path I was walking was a lonely one. I wanted revenge, but not in the way most people think. It wasn’t about taking from others—it was about reclaiming what was mine. It was about standing up and saying, “I am not your victim.” It was about the raw need to prove that I could succeed, that I was worth more than the label people put on me.
                
                I want revenge from all humanity, at all cost, i hate humanity, human is a trash race, I fell a shame that i myself a human, i want to revenge on every human kind alive
                
                But I couldn’t escape the truth of my past. The rage I felt was born from years of watching the people I loved suffer, from years of feeling helpless and ignored. It was hard to keep moving forward without letting the bitterness consume me. I wanted to be stronger, but sometimes, I didn’t know how to be, that's why, I want REVENGE, revenge of every human alive, revenge of what happened to me.
                
                Yet, I kept going. The weight of my past still loomed over me, but I wasn’t the same person I had been. I had learned to survive. Now, it was time to learn how to truly live.

        <div id="fight" class="arc-content">
            <h2>The Fight</h2>
            <p>During the break, I was casually on my laptop, sitting next to Saad, just chilling. I decided to move over and sit in a seat that wasn’t technically mine, thinking that when the break ended, I’d just get up and go back to my own seat without any fuss. But as soon as the bell rang, he was on me, practically rushing over.

                He didn’t hold back, coming at me with insults right away: “What’s wrong with you? You donkey, you idiot! What are you doing here?” I stayed calm, not giving him the reaction he was probably expecting. But then it hit me—I knew exactly how I wanted to respond. Without a second thought, I grabbed him by the jaw and threw a solid punch.
                
                He tried to retaliate, landing a shot, but the pain didn’t faze me. Adrenaline kicked in, numbing any impact as we clashed. It wasn’t long before a bigger guy stepped in to separate us, putting an end to it. Still, I felt a sense of satisfaction.
                
                When I got out of class afterward, my leg was shaking like crazy—pure adrenaline running out of my system. I headed straight to Emad and let him know, “I just beat someone.” Without missing a beat, he took charge, walking back to class with a message for everyone: “That’s what you get when you mess with Motaz. You mess with him, you mess with me. You’re not even worth his shoes.” Seeing Emad back me up like that gave me a solid feeling of support.

        <div id="reputation-boost" class="arc-content">
            <h2>A Reputation Boost</h2>
            <p>After school, I got a call from my classmate Ehab, one of the most energetic and outgoing people in class. Ehab and I go way back, with plenty of memories from past years. He invited me to the wedding of our mutual friend Abd al-Wadood's brother. Ehab and Abd al-Wadood have been friends since first grade, so I agreed to go with him.

                That day, I went to my best friend Saden’s house. We had a great time and even managed to fix a laptop. Around 6:30, I got home, only to get another call from Ehab, asking if I was still up for going to the wedding. I asked my mom if I could go, but she said no. Hearing the disappointment in Ehab’s voice when he replied, "Oh," made me feel like I couldn’t let him down. I put him on hold, managed to convince my dad to let me go for 30 minutes, and then headed out.
                
                At the wedding, Ehab and I congratulated Abd al-Wadood. On our way back, walking through the chilly night, Ehab told me, “I won’t forget that you came with me tonight. You’ve really proven yourself.” I just replied, “It was no problem.”
                
                When I got home, I went straight to bed, feeling fulfilled.

            <h2>A Dream</h2>
            <p>Last night, I had a vivid and intense dream. It started in a street where I was walking with my brother. Out of nowhere, a woman appeared and desperately begged for help. She said someone was trying to kill her. Without thinking, we both agreed to help her, and we rushed to the elevator. As we entered, there was a strange meter on the wall that showed a "danger level." It was at 64, which felt alarming.

                We hurried to my grandma's house to take her there for safety, but as soon as we arrived, the man chasing her broke in. He tried to attack my brother, but I stepped in front and pushed him away. He looked at me and said, “You hit me, so you’re going to die.” That’s when things got worse.
                
                He pulled out a knife and sliced my left thigh. The pain was intense, and I acted as if I couldn’t move, hoping it would give me an advantage. I grabbed the knife, but he still kept me pinned down, unable to fight back properly. No one came to help, and I was left struggling alone.
                
                Then, he sliced my left chest. Despite the pain, I was determined to keep fighting. I tried to jump at him, to attack, but just as I made my move, the dream ended.

        <div id="work" class="arc-content">
            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>After starting my short-lived job at the Cheetah factory, I was ready to put in the hours and earn my paycheck. But things didn’t go as expected. On payday, I messaged the manager to get my earnings, only to get a call accusing me of theft—claiming I’d tried to steal an ink printer. It was absurd. He demanded my dad’s number, and I gave it, though he never even called him.

                Eventually, my dad had to reach out, and this manager shifted his story, saying he wasn’t accusing me of theft but “attempted” theft, implying I’d opened a product and put it back. The whole thing felt like a setup, especially since I’d heard he’d tried a similar trick with Saden.
                
                My dad wasn’t having it and considered filing a police report to hold the manager accountable. Accusations without proof, especially against someone my age, are no joke. On top of that, the guy seemed to target younger workers like me and even those with disabilities, trying to get away without paying what he owed.
                
                In the end, the situation worked out in my favor. I got my 300 shekels back, along with an extra 250 after as a “gift”. That brought the total to 550 shekels—a win, despite all the hassle.</p>

                Average Score: 72.5/100
                
                With an average of 72.5, this term’s performance is a wake-up call. It’s not just about boosting my grades but about the class as a whole. The manager might step in with more intense expectations if things don’t improve. Right now, it’s a reminder that raising these scores isn’t just personal—it’s about preserving our class's reputation and the environment we’re in.

            <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>If you ask me about my mother, she’s the person I love most in this world. In fact, she’s the only person I feel capable of truly loving. She’s been my anchor, my safe harbor in a storm I never asked to face. I owe her everything, and there’s no room in my heart to love anyone else the way I love her.

                As for my father, I respect him. That’s it. He doesn’t feel like a father to me in the way most people would imagine. His actions toward my mother left marks on both of us, wounds that never fully healed. Respect is all I can offer him, and even that feels strained at times.
                
                When it comes to my grandmother on my father’s side, I can’t hold back my hatred. She’s the reason I was born prematurely, at seven months. She forced my mother to climb stairs endlessly, all because she demanded everything be done her way, regardless of whether it was right or wrong. Her control knew no bounds, and the damage she caused is something I’ll never forgive.
                
                My grandfather on my father’s side is a different story. I don’t know much about him—he divorced my grandmother and left his sons behind. Despite his absence, he’s always treated me kindly. I respect him for that. It’s a quiet respect, one without much history to anchor it, but it’s there nonetheless.
                
                My grandparents on my mother’s side are nothing like the ones from my father’s. They’re kind, caring, and sweet. Their warmth and love have always been a source of comfort to me. I respect them deeply—more than words can fully express.
                
                And then there are my brothers. Like any siblings, we fight, sometimes intensely. But no matter how heated things get, we always find our way back to being brothers. If one of them needs something from me, I do my best to fulfill it, even if it’s difficult for me. I’ve never been the type to ask much from them in return; I prefer it that way. Maybe it’s my way of keeping peace, or maybe it’s just who I am.
